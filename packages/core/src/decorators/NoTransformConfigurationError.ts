   * Whether to throw an error or not.

   * If you set this value to `false`, {@link NoTransformConfigurationError} will
   * not throw an error.
   *
   * Even if you've not configured the plugin transformer of `tsconfig.json` file,
   * the error will not be thrown and the program will be continued. Instead, every
   * validations and assertions will be skipped and the value will be returned as it is.
   * Furthermore, unexpected behaviors may occur.
   *
   * Therefore, it is not recommended to set this value to `false` in production
   * environment. Configure this value to be `false` only when you're debugging or testing.
   *
   * By the way, if you hope the `false` value to be set, you have to do it before the first.
   * If you configure the `false` value after the `@nestia/core` decorator functions are
   * composed, the value will not be applied and the error will be thrown.
