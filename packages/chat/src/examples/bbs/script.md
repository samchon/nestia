Title is "Introduce `typia`, superfast runtime validator", and thumbnail URL is https://typia.io/logo.png

Content body is below.

`typia` is a transformer library supporting below features:

- Super-fast runtime validators
- Enhanced JSON schema and serde functions
- LLM function calling schema and structured output
- Protocol Buffer encoder and decoder
- Random data generator

For reference, `typia`'s runtime validator 20,000x faster than `class-validator` by utilizing the AoT (Ahead of Time) compilation strategy. Let's visit typia website https://typia.io, and enjoy its super-fast performance.

I'll create a new article more.

The content body is below.

`nestia` is a set of helper libraries for NestJS.

- `@nestia/core`: Super-fast decorators
- `@nestia/sdk`: SDK/Swagger generators with native TypeScript types
