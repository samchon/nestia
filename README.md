```bash
# INSTALL NESTIA
npm install --save-dev nestia

# BUILDING SDK LIBRARY
npx nestia sdk "src/controller" --out "src/api"
npx nestia sdk "src/**/*.controller.ts" --out "src/api"
npx nestia sdk "src/controller" \ 
    --exclude "src/controller/test" \
    --out "src/api"

# BUILDING SWAGGER.JSON IS ALSO POSSIBLE
npx nestia swagger "src/controller" -- out "swagger.json"
```

Don't write any swagger comment and DTO decorator. Just run the `nestia` up.

  - No swagger comment/decorator
  - No DTO comment/decorator
  - Only pure `interface`s and NestJS code are required
    - Support generic typed `interface`s and `controller`s
    - Support union/intersection types
    - Support conditional types

The `nestia` is an evolved automatic `SDK` and `Swagger` generator than ever, who does not require any type of swagger comment or DTO decorator function, by analyzing your `NestJS` developed backend server code in the compilation level (`nestia` utilizes the TypeScript Compiler API).

Therefore, don't write any swagger comment and don't use any DTO related decorator function. Just use the pure interface type with the pure `NestJS` code. Reading below sections and looking at example codes of the `nestia`, feel how the `nestia` is much stronger than the legacy `@nestjs/swagger`.

Components | `nestia`::SDK | `nestia`::swagger | `@nestjs/swagger`
-----------|---|---|---
DTO with pure interface | ✔ | ✔ | ❌
descriptions by comments | ✔ | ✔ | ❌
Simple structure | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
Generic typed structure | ✔ | ✔ | ❌
Union typed structure | ✔ | ✔ | ▲
Intersection typed structure | ✔ | ✔ | ▲
Conditional typed structure | ✔ | ▲ | ❌
Auto completion | ✔ | ❌ | ❌

## Demonstrations
### Pure DTO Interface
The `nestia` can utilize the pure interface type as DTO.

Unlike the legacy `@nestjs/swagger` who requires a class with decorator functions when defining the DTO, the `nestia` can use the pure interface directly. Also, `nestia` can use the descriptive comments of the pure DTO interface, too.

Furthermore, as the `nestia` can use the pure interface type directly, it's possible to define a generic typed DTO interface with inheritance. Of course, using alis type or union typed DTO are also possibble, too. Besides, `@nestjs/swagger` never can construct such generic typed DTO and constructing union typed DTO is possible but extremely difficult.

  - Simple [`ISaleArticleComment`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/simple/src/api/structures/ISaleArticleComment.ts)
  - Generic interfaces
    - grandparent interface, [`ISaleArticle<Content>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleArticle.ts)
    - parent interface, [`ISaleInquiry<Content>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleInquiry.ts)
    - 1st sub-type interface, [`ISaleQuestion`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleQuestion.ts)
    - 2nd sub-type interface, [`ISaleReview`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleReview.ts)
  - Union alias type [`ISaleEntireArticle`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleArticle.ts)

Looking at the below example code, then you may understand which differences between the `nestia` and `@nestjs/swagger` and what the pure interface DTO type means. Writing the legacy DTO class of the `@nestjs/swagger` after a very long time, I felt the feeling again, "this is insane".

### Advanced Controller Class
Controller also can use the generic arguments.

In the previous [Pure DTO Interface](#pure-dto-interface) corner, we've learned that the `nestia` can use the pure interface type as the DTO. Also, we've learned that using the pure interface type as DTO means that making generic typed interface or union typed interface as the DTO are also possible, too.

In the Controller case, it's the same with the upper interface story. In the `nestia`, as using generic typed interface as DTO was possible, defining generic typed controller class is also possible, too. By defining the generic typed controller class as the super type class, you can extremely reduce both duplicated code and duplicated description comments.

Look at the below code and feel how the `nestia` is powerful. I repeat that, `@nestjs/swagger` never can construct such generic or union typed controller classes, either.

  - Simple [`CustomerSaleArticleCommentsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/blob/master/demo/simple/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleArticleCommentsController.ts)
  - Generic controllers
    - abstract controller, [`SaleInquiriesController<Content, Store, Json>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/SaleInquiriesController.ts)
    - 1st sub-type controller, [`ConsumerSaleQuestionsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleQuestionsController.ts)
    - 2nd sub-type controller, [`ConsumerSaleQuestionsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleQuestionsController.ts)
  - Union controller, [`ConsumerSaleEntireArticlesController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/union/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleEntireArticlesController.ts)

```typescript
import * as express from "express";
import * as nest from "@nestjs/common";
import helper from "nestia-helper";

import { ISaleInquiry } from "@api/structures/ISaleInquiry";

export abstract class SaleInquiriesController<
        Content extends ISaleInquiry.IContent,
        Store extends ISaleInquiry.IStore,
        Json extends ISaleInquiry<Content>>
{
    /**

    @nest.Post()

     */
    @nest.Put(":id")
    public update
        (
            @nest.Request() request: express.Request,
            @helper.TypedParam("section", "string") section: string, 
            @helper.TypedParam("saleId", "string") saleId: string,
            @helper.TypedParam("id", "number") id: number,
            @nest.Body() input: Store
        ): Promise<Json>;
}
```




### Software Development Kit
> `Swagger` is torturing the client developers.
>
> If you're a backend developer and you deliver a `Swagger` to your companion client developers, the client developers should analyze the `Swagger` and implement duplicated router functions with DTO interfaces by themselves. During those jobs, if the client developers take a mistake by mis-reading the `Swagger`, it becomes the critical runtime error directly.
>
> Why do you torture the client developers such like that? If you deliver an SDK (Software Development Kit) instead of the `Swagger`, the client developers don't need to read the `Swagger` file and don't need to implement the duplicated DTO interfaces and router functions, either.
>
> Therefore, just build the SDK through this `nestia` and delivers the SDK. Your client developers would be anticipated from the long time torturing and become happy. Your solution would be much more reliable and efficient, too.

Looking at the SDK library file, generated by the `nestia`, it seems perfect.

Exact route method, path and parameters are constructed and DTO structures are perfectly imported. Also, descriptive comments written on the controller class methods, DTO interfaces and their properties are exactly revied in the SDK library.

Furthermore, there's not any problem even when the generic typed abstract controller classes with generic typed DTO comes. The `nestia` will specialize the generic arguments exactly, by analyzing your `NestJS` developed backend server code, in the compilation level.

### Swagger
Building `Swagger` is also possible and even much powerful.

Although I think the `Swagger` is a typical tool that torturing the client developers, the `nestia` also can build the `swagger.json` file. Even `Swagger` generator of the `nestia` is much powerful and convenient than the `@nestjs/swagger`. It doesn't require any type of the swagger comment or DTO decorator function and just using the pure interface type as DTO is possible.

Looking at the [simple/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Fsimple%2Fswagger.json) file, generated by the `nestia`, it seems perfect. Exact route method, path and parameters are constructed and DTO structures are exactly same with the pure interace type `ISaleArticleComment`. Also, comments written on the controller class method, DTO interface `ISaleArticleComment` and its properties are exactly revied on the `description` fields in the `swagger.json`.

Looking at the another file [generic/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Fgeneric%2Fswagger.json), you can find that there isn't any problem even when the generic typed DTO interfaces or controller classes come. Furthermore, traveling the `description` properties of the [generic/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Funion%2Fswagger.json), comments written on the generic interfaces and controllers are exactly revived in each route functions and schema definitions.

## Configuration
Components                   | `nestia.config.ts` | `CLI` | `@nestjs/swagger`
-----------------------------|--------------------|-------|------------------
Swagger Generation           | ✔  | ✔  | ✔
SDK Generation               | ✔  | ✔  | ❌
2x faster `JSON.stringify()` | ✔  | ❌ | ❌
Type check in runtime        | ✔  | ❌ | ❌
Custom compiler options      | ✔  | ❌ | ❌

You can configure the nestia builder options by two ways: `CLI` or `configuration file`.

The CLI (Command Line Interface) is easy to use, because it does not require any type of configuration file wrinting. However, it's not safe thing that repeating the same command whenever generating the SDK or `swagger.json` through the CLI, because command miswriting can be happened.

```bash
# BASIC COMMAND
npx nestia <nestia|swagger> <source_directories_or_patterns> \
    --exclude <exclude_directory_or_pattern> \
    --out <output_directory_or_file>

# EXAMPLES
npx nestia nestia "src/controllers" --out "src/api"
npx nestia swagger "src/**/*.controller.ts" -- out "swagger.json"
npx nestia swagger "src/main/controllers" "src/sub/controllers" \
    --exclude "src/main/test" \
    --out "composite.swagger.json"

# ONLY WHEN NESTIA.CONFIG.TS EXISTS
npx nestia nestia
npx nestia swagger
```

Otherwise, configuration file `nestia.config.ts` may hard to construct and the construction would be annoying and inconvenient, such configuration would be useful within framework of the reusability. Also, the configuration file `nestia.config.ts` use much detailed options than the `CLI` and its content can be ensured its safety by TypeScript compiler through the `IConfigruation` interface type.

When you've completed to reading the `IConfiguration` interface, let's make the `nestia.config.ts` file directly. At first, move to your project directory. Note that the project directory means the top level directory of your project, where configuration files like `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` are placed in. After the movement, make the new `nestia` configuration file and write some script like below:

```typescript
import type { IConfiguration } from "nestia";

export const NESTIA_CONFIG: IConfiguration = {
    input: "./src/controllers",
    output: "./src/api",
    json: true,
    swagger: {
        output: "./public/swagger.json"
    }
};
export default NESTIA_CONFIG;
```




## Appendix
### Dependencies of the SDK
An SDK library generated by the `nestia` requires the [nestia-fetcher](https://github.com/samchon/nestia-fetcher) module. Also, the [typescript-is](https://github.com/woutervh-/typescript-is) and [typescript-json](https://github.com/samchon/typescript-json) modules can be required following your nestia.config.ts options.

```json
{
  "name": "payments-server-api",
  "dependencies": {
    "nestia-fetcher": "^2.0.1",
    "typescript-is": "^0.19.0",
    "typescript-json": "^2.0.9"
  }
}
```

The `npx nestia install` command installs those dependencies with the `package.json` configuration.

```bash
# MOVE TO THE DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY
cd packages/api

# INSTALL DEPENDENCIES OF THE SDK
npx nestia install
```

### Template Repository
https://github.com/samchon/backend

I support template backend project using this `nestia` library, `samchon/backend`.

Reading the README content of the backend template repository, you can find lots of example backend projects who've been generated from the backend. Furthermore, those example projects guide how to generate SDK library from the `nestia` and how to distribute the SDK library thorugh the NPM module.

Therefore, if you're planning to compose your own backend project using this `nestia`, I recommend you to create the repository and learn from the `samchon/backend` template project.

### Archidraw

I have special thanks to the Archidraw, where I'm working for.

The Archidraw is a great IT company developing 3D interior editor and lots of solutions based on the 3D assets. Also, the Archidraw is the first company who had adopted this nestia on their commercial backend project, even this nestia was in the alpha level.
