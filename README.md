`nestia` is an evolved `SDK` and `Swagger` generator, which analyzes your `NestJS` server code in the compilation level. With `nestia` and compilation level analyzer, you don't need to write any swagger or class-validator decorators. All you need to do is use the `nestia` CLI as shown below.

Reading below contents, feel how the "compilation level" makes `nestia` stronger.

```typescript
// IMPORT SDK LIBRARY GENERATED BY NESTIA
import api from "@samchon/shopping-api";
import { IPage } from "@samchon/shopping-api/lib/structures/IPage";
import { ISale } from "@samchon/shopping-api/lib/structures/ISale";
import { ISaleArticleComment } from "@samchon/shopping-api/lib/structures/ISaleArticleComment";
import { ISaleQuestion } from "@samchon/shopping-api/lib/structures/ISaleQuestion";

export async function trace_sale_question_and_comment
    (connection: api.IConnection): Promise<void>
{
    // LIST UP SALE SUMMARIES
    const index: IPage<ISale.ISummary> = await api.functional.shoppings.sales.index
    (
        connection,
        "general",
        { limit: 100, page: 1 }
    );

    // PICK A SALE
    const sale: ISale = await api.functional.shoppings.sales.at
    (
        connection, 
        index.data[0].id
    );
    console.log("sale", sale);

    // WRITE A QUESTION
    const question: ISaleQuestion = await api.functional.shoppings.sales.questions.store
    (
        connection,
        "general",
        sale.id,
        {
            title: "How to use this product?",
            body: "The description is not fully enough. Can you introduce me more?",
            files: []
        }
    );
    console.log("question", question);

    // WRITE A COMMENT
    const comment: ISaleArticleComment = await api.functional.shoppings.sales.comments.store
    (
        connection,
        "general",
        sale.id,
        question.id,
        {
            body: "p.s) Can you send me a detailed catalogue?",
            anonymous: false
        }
    );
    console.log("comment", comment);
}
```



## Setup
Just like any other package, you've got to install it before you can use it.

```sh
npm install --save-dev nestia
```

After the installation, you can generate the `SDK` or `Swagger`, directly.

```sh
npx nestia sdk "src/**/*.controller" --out "src/api"
npx nestia swagger "src/**/*.controller" --out "swagger.json"
```

> If all of your controller files are gathered into one directory:
>
> ```sh
> npx nestia sdk "src/controllers" --out "src/api"
> npx nestia swagger "src/controllers" --out "swagger.json"
> ```
> 
> You can omit all of the parameters if you've configured the [nestia.config.ts](#configuration) file.
> 
> ```sh
> npx nestia sdk
> npx nestia swagger
> ```




## Demonstrations
### Pure DTO Interface
`nestia` can utilize pure interface type as DTO.

Unlike `@nestjs/swagger` which requires the DTO class with decorators, `nestia` can use the pure interface type directly. Also, `nestia` can utilize the pure descriptive comments, instead of using the `description` property of the decorators. Furthermore, `nestia` can even support generic types, union/intersection types and even conditional types.

Look at the code below, you may see the difference between `nestia` and `@nestjs/swagger`, and thereby catch the meaning of the pure DTO interface.

  - Simple [`ISaleArticleComment`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/simple/src/api/structures/ISaleArticleComment.ts)
  - Generic interfaces
    - grandparent interface, [`ISaleArticle<Content>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleArticle.ts)
    - parent interface, [`ISaleInquiry<Content>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleInquiry.ts)
    - 1st sub-type interface, [`ISaleQuestion`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleQuestion.ts)
    - 2nd sub-type interface, [`ISaleReview`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/api/structures/ISaleReview.ts)
  - Union alias type [`ISaleEntireArticle`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/union/src/api/structures/ISaleEntireArticle.ts)

### Advanced Controller Class
Controller also can use the generic arguments.

In the previous [Pure DTO Interface](#pure-dto-interface) corner, we've learned that `nestia` can use the pure interface type as DTO. Also, we've learned that utilizing generic, union/intersection and even conditional typed interfaces are also possible.

In the Controller case, it's same with the upper DTO story. With `nestia`, defining a generic typed controller class is also possible, too. By defining a generic typed controller class as a super-type class, you can reduce both duplicated code and description comments.

Look at the below code and feel how powerful `nestia` is. It should be stated that, `@nestjs/swagger` cannot construct such generic or union typed controller class.

  - Simple [`CustomerSaleArticleCommentsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/blob/master/demo/simple/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleArticleCommentsController.ts)
  - Generic controllers
    - abstract controller, [`SaleInquiriesController<Content, Store, Json>`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/SaleInquiriesController.ts)
    - 1st sub-type controller, [`ConsumerSaleQuestionsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleQuestionsController.ts)
    - 2nd sub-type controller, [`ConsumerSaleQuestionsController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/generic/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleQuestionsController.ts)
  - Union controller, [`ConsumerSaleEntireArticlesController`](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/master/demo/union/src/controllers/ConsumerSaleEntireArticlesController.ts)

> [typescript-json](https://github.com/samchon/typescript-json) can replace the class-validator with only one line.

> ```typescript
> import * as nest from "@nestjs/common";
> import { assert } from "typescript-json";

>         ISaleQuestion,
>         ISaleQuestion.IContent,

### Software Development Kit
> `Swagger` is torturing client developers.
>
> If you're a backend developer and you deliver a `Swagger` to your companion client developers, they should analyze the `Swagger` and implement duplicated router functions with DTO interfaces by themselves. During those jobs, if a client developer takes a mistake by mis-reading the `Swagger`, it becomes a critical runtime error directly.
>
> Why are you torturing the client developers such like that? If you deliver an SDK (Software Development Kit) instead of the `Swagger`, the client developers don't need to read the `Swagger` file. They never need to implement the duplicated DTO interfaces with router functions, either.
>
> Therefore, just build the SDK through this `nestia` and deliver the SDK. Your client developers would be anticipated from the long time torturing and become happy. Your solution would be much more reliable and efficient, too.

Looking at the SDK library file, generated by `nestia`, it is perfect.

Route method, path and parameters are well-formed and DTO structures are correctly imported. Also, descriptive comments are fully revived in the SDK library, regardless of where they are written.

Furthermore, there's not any problem even when a generic typed controller class comes. `nestia` will specialize the generic arguments exactly, by analyzing your `NestJS` server code, in the compilation level.

### Swagger
Building `Swagger` is also possible and even much powerful.

Looking at the [simple/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Fsimple%2Fswagger.json) file, generated by `nestia`, everything is perfect. Route method, path and parameters are well-formed. Also, schema definitions are exactly matched with the pure interface type `ISaleArticleComment`. Of course, descriptive comments are perfectly resurrected in the `description` properties of the `swagger.json` file.

Looking at the another file [generic/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Fgeneric%2Fswagger.json), you can find that there isn't any problem even when a generic typed DTO and controller come. The last file [union/swagger.json](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsamchon%2Fnestia%2Fmaster%2Fdemo%2Funion%2Fswagger.json), there's no problem on the union type, either.

## Configuration
Components                   | `nestia.config.ts` | `CLI` | `@nestjs/swagger`
-----------------------------|--------------------|-------|------------------
Swagger Generation           | ✔  | ✔  | ✔
SDK Generation               | ✔  | ✔  | ❌
2x faster `JSON.stringify()` | ✔  | ❌ | ❌
Type check in runtime        | ✔  | ❌ | ❌
Custom compiler options      | ✔  | ❌ | ❌

`nestia` can configure generator options by two ways: CLI and configuration file.

At first, the CLI (Command Line Interface) is convenient, but does not support detailed options.

```sh
# BASIC COMMAND
npx nestia <sdk|swagger> <source_directories_or_patterns> \
    --exclude <exclude_directory_or_pattern> \
    --out <output_directory_or_file>

# EXAMPLES
npx nestia sdk "src/controllers" --out "src/api"
npx nestia swagger "src/**/*.controller.ts" --out "swagger.json"
npx nestia swagger "src/main/controllers" "src/sub/controllers" \
    --exclude "src/main/test" \
    --out "composite.swagger.json"

# ONLY WHEN NESTIA.CONFIG.TS EXISTS
npx nestia sdk
npx nestia swagger
```

Besides, the configuration file `nestia.config.ts` supports much detailed options. 

The detailed options are listed up to the `IConfiguration` interface. You can utilize the `IConfiguration` type like below. If you want to know more about those options, please check the [Guide Documents](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/wiki/Configuration).

## Appendix
### Dependencies of the SDK
An SDK library generated by `nestia` requires [nestia-fetcher](https://github.com/samchon/nestia-fetcher) module. Also, [typescript-is](https://github.com/woutervh-/typescript-is) and [typescript-json](https://github.com/samchon/typescript-json) modules can be required following your `nestia.config.ts` configuration file.

The `npx nestia install` command installs those dependencies with the `package.json` configuration.

```bash
# MOVE TO THE DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY
cd packages/api

# INSTALL DEPENDENCIES OF THE SDK
npx nestia install
```

### Template Repository
https://github.com/samchon/backend

I support template backend project using this `nestia` library, `samchon/backend`.

Reading the README content of the backend template repository, you can find lots of example backend projects who've been generated from the backend. Furthermore, those example projects guide how to generate SDK library from `nestia` and how to distribute the SDK library thorugh the NPM module.

Therefore, if you're planning to compose your own backend project using this `nestia`, I recommend you to create the repository and learn from the `samchon/backend` template project.

### Archidraw

I have special thanks to the Archidraw, where I'm working for.

The Archidraw is a great IT company developing 3D interior editor and lots of solutions based on the 3D assets. Also, the Archidraw is the first company who had adopted this nestia on their commercial backend project, even this nestia was in the alpha level.
