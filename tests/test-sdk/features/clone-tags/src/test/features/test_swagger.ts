/**
 * Verifies checks store and update Swagger tags equal bbs, public, write.

 * Those tags are authored on the fixture controller and its route declarations.
 *
 * 1. Execute the authored feature through its prepared generated artifacts.
 * 2. Assert the distinctions described below.
 *
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#behavioral-verification Checks store and update Swagger tags equal bbs, public, write.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#independent-expectations Those tags are authored on the fixture controller and its route declarations.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#distinguishing-cases Both POST and PUT retain the ordered controller and operation tag list.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#execution-ownership The exported case is discovered by the feature src/test/index.ts after start.js compiles the generated consumer; compiler and host preparation make this an E2E population.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#necessary-boundary Checks store and update Swagger tags equal bbs, public, write. The assertion observes generated output or its connected consumer, rather than a committed repository arrangement.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#shared-execution The feature runner shares generation and prepared artifacts with its sibling cases. Compatible programs are batched by start.js; distinct feature programs still incur separate consumer/host preparation, which is an unresolved suite consolidation limitation.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#state-isolation-and-reuse-validity This case consumes the feature-specific generated artifacts and connection; local connector, application or temporary consumer cleanup is owned by its try/finally where created. Outer backend lifecycle belongs to the feature entry and exceptional startup cleanup remains a harness limitation.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#preserved-coverage Both POST and PUT retain the ordered controller and operation tag list. Existing assertions remain at this executable owner; no branch is removed or claimed to be transferred to units.
